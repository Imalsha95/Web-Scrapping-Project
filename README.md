Web Scraping to Get Data of the Largest Companies by Revenue in the States

Project Overview
This project focuses on web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to obtain and analyze information about the largest companies by revenue in the United States. The primary goal is to create a comprehensive dataset through web scraping and then provide meaningful insights and visualizations based on this data.

Project Steps

Web Scraping:
Utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape data from reliable sources.
Extracted relevant information about the largest companies, including their names, revenues, industries, and other pertinent details.
Data Cleaning:

Processed and cleaned the scraped data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Handled missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.
Standardized data formats for ease of analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed EDA to understand the distribution, trends, and patterns in the data.
Identified outliers and anomalies using statistical methods (IQR and Z-score).
Generated summary statistics to get an overall sense of the dataset.
Data Visualization:

Created visual representations of the data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Developed charts and graphs to illustrate key insights, such as revenue distributions, top industries, and regional analyses.
Highlighted outliers and significant trends through visual aids.
